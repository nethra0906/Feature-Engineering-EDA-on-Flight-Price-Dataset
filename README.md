**Flight Price Prediction â€” Feature Engineering**
**Overview**
- A project exploring and preparing the Kaggle Flight Price Prediction dataset for modeling flight ticket prices using feature engineering.

**Dataset Description**
- Contains flight details from six major Indian cities: Airline, Source City, Departure Date & Time, Arrival Date & Time, Route, Duration, Total Stops, Class (Economy / Business), and Price (target variable) 

**Feature Engineering (FE)**
- Data Cleaning:
